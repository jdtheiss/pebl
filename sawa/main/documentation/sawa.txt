IntroductionThe main component of SAWA is the subject array, a structural array that can contain subject-specific information to be utilized in wrapping functions. At its simplest, SAWA is an organizational tool that can maintain up-to-date information as well as record analyses and other notes. However, SAWA is built to feed information from the subject array to a wrapper for any batch, function, or command. As such, SAWA provides users the ability to perform complex analyses using subject data in SPM, AFNI, FSL, etc., or any unix/C/matlab commands. With wrapper automation for batch utility, command line, and matlab functions, users can build simple pipelines for repeat analyses and combine batch, matlab, or command line functions. The batch editor directly uses matlab’s batch utility system, which allows users to directly choose variables that will be filled by the subject array or other functions/variables. The command line editor allows users to wrap command line functions while also selecting command line switches to use and set. Finally, the function wrapper utility provides users the ability to wrap matlab functions by setting input arguments and selecting output arguments to be returned.As a way to record analyses that users have run, SAWA also prints inputs/outputs/errors. Users can add notes into the analysis records and save records for different subject arrays (e.g. different studies). Records are stored by analysis name and date.InstallationSAWA is available for download and is updated on github (see citation above for link). After you have downloaded the zipped file folder and moved it to your desired location, go into the “sawa/main/functions” folder and open “sawa.m” in matlab. Simply run the function, and SAWA will be automatically be added to your matlab path. At this point, you may close the “sawa.m” file and begin using SAWA through its graphical user interface (GUI).
